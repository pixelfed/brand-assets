# Pixelfed Artwork and Branding Assets

## Usage Guidelines

Pixelfed as a brand is represented by two primary symbols, logo and mascot. This
is a detailed description and a guide for usage of both of them.

### Logo

		When using Pixelfed logos you need to keep in mind that it's to
		represent software and creators of the software. Usage of the
		logos in ways which are incompatible with that idea is not
		recommended.

#### Description

Circle consists of 5 equal segments of circle, each made out of big circle pie
style segment with a halfcircle of half of diameter of the outer circle
connected by the straight edge to the radius edge on the bottom side when
starting with radius cutting the circle directly to the east from the center of
it. Colours are applied to the segments clockwise based on colours below,
starting with the shape furthest northeast. Shadow is applied as a difference
between the segment and segment offset by 10% of the absolute width of the
circle away from the center of the circle, black 30% transparency. On top of
that overlaid is white shape consisting of halfcircle on the right, connected to
a sqare with rounded edge on top left of 25% radius on the right, 1/3rd width,
2/3 height, 2/3 width of total shape, connected to a sqare triangle on bottom
left, edge width 1/3:1/3 of the shape. That shape is of width of 1/3 of the
circle, perfectly in the middle of the circle. Symbolic version lacks shadows
and the circle is not segmented.
